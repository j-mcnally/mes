# MiddlemanEmberScaffold

A gem to easily scaffold middleman projects that leverage EmberJS, Emblem and Bootstrap. 

Emblem is basically haml for Handlebars.

Also includes some sweet bootstrap sweetness.

I mean cloning a boilerplate repo isn't as cool.

The commandline boilerplate was "borrowed" from middleman.

## Installation

    $ gem install mes

## Usage

make sure to install middleman first

    $ gem install middleman

then 

    $ mes help


-or-

    $ mes new [folder]
